# An Orb Creations Math App

Last README update: Tuesday, April 6, 2021.

This is a math app bootstrapped with [Orb's React template](https://github.orbclouds.com?id=606be6b8ab35fd6d45a1a587&to=606019a808e440587e87d7c5) for deployment on Orb's HyperEdge. This was created as part of the [Orb Creations YouTube series](https://yt.orbclouds.com?id=606be6b8ab35fd6d45a1a587&to=6061d2708e440587e87d7c6).

This app is LIVE [here](https://app.orbclouds.com?id=606be6b8ab35fd6d45a1a587&to=606be6a9ab35fd6d45a1a586).

**`yarn start`** spins up a development server on `PORT 3000`.

**`yarn build`** builds the application for production into the `/build` directory.

**`yarn serve`** serves a built application locally.

All source code is contained in the `/src` directory.
